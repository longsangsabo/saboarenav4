## ADVANCEMENT MAP SUMMARY

**Winner Bracket → Loser Bracket:**
- WB R1 losers (L1-L8) → LB R1 matches (16-23)
- WB R2 losers (L9-L12) → LB R2 matches (24-27)
- WB R3 losers (L13-L14) → LB R3 matches (28-29)
- WB R4 loser (L15) → LB R4 match (30)

**Loser Bracket Flow:**
- LB R1 winners (16-23) → LB R2 (24-27)
- LB R2 winners (24-27) → LB R3 (28-29)
- LB R3 winners (28-29) → LB R4 (30)
- LB R4 winner (30) → Grand Final (31)

**Note:** In true double elimination, if WB champion loses Grand Final, there should be a bracket reset. This implementation does NOT include bracket reset - Grand Final is single match only.

## FIXED ISSUES:

### ❌ OLD (WRONG):
```dart
map[16] = {'winner': 20, 'loser': null};  // WRONG! 20 is still LB R1
map[17] = {'winner': 20, 'loser': null};
```

### ✅ NEW (CORRECT):
```dart
map[16] = {'winner': 24, 'loser': null};  // Correct! 24 is LB R2
map[17] = {'winner': 24, 'loser': null};
map[18] = {'winner': 25, 'loser': null};
map[19] = {'winner': 25, 'loser': null};
map[20] = {'winner': 26, 'loser': null};
map[21] = {'winner': 26, 'loser': null};
map[22] = {'winner': 27, 'loser': null};
map[23] = {'winner': 27, 'loser': null};
```

Now the structure is correct! LB R1 has 8 matches (16-23), and winners advance to LB R2 (24-27).
